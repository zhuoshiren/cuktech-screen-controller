# CUKTECH AP01 shared FDS relay

The relay lets an AP01 owner without a Xiaomi gateway perform the one-time
real-time loader installation. It is not part of normal screen delivery: after
installation, AP01 fetches `/screen.gif` (legacy) or `/screen.ap2b` (two-page)
directly from the owner's LAN Bridge.

## User requirements

- a powered CUKTECH AP01 paired and online in the owner's Mi Home account;
- AP01 model/firmware exactly `njcuk.enstor.ap01 / 1.0.2_0031`;
- the Controller computer and AP01 on the same non-isolated LAN;
- CUKTECH Screen Controller.

No gateway purchase, firmware file, USB data cable or command line is needed.
The app performs read-only checks and host-side CDN readback first, then
requires explicit confirmation immediately before the Flash write.

## Trust boundary

The client sends only API version, fixed model/version, its private-LAN Bridge
URL and refresh interval. The relay never receives Mi Home credentials, AP01
DID/MAC, Claude/Codex sessions or arbitrary firmware uploads.

Server guarantees:

- stock image pinned to SHA-256
  `8a721fc8ef25458d415b2460e4a251e0503a82f7743fdff85b12612190e5c1cb`;
- only private IPv4 `http://IP:8765/screen.gif` or `/screen.ap2b` targets;
- no arbitrary upload endpoint;
- existing Recovery CRC, changed-range, payload readback and relocation checks;
- Xiaomi OTA CDN host pinning;
- client-side BFNP, size, SHA-256 and MD5 verification;
- signed URLs excluded from normal logs;
- per-client and global rate limits with serialized builds/uploads.

## Run the origin

The operator needs a locally signed-in Mi Home account containing a real
`lumi.gateway.*` or `xiaomi.gateway.*` device, the private hash-matching stock
image, Python dependencies, and `riscv64-elf-gcc/binutils`.

```bash
python3 ap01_fds_relay_server.py \
  --stock-firmware /private/path/ap01-1.0.2_0031.bin \
  --cache-dir "$HOME/Library/Caches/CUKTECH Screen Controller/fds-relay" \
  --bind 127.0.0.1 --port 8790 --trust-proxy
```

Keep credentials, gateway identifiers, firmware and signed URLs out of Git.
Expose the loopback origin only through an HTTPS reverse proxy such as
Cloudflare Tunnel. Publish its stable URL in the maintainer's discovery JSON
(`relay-service.json` documents the format); set `enabled` to `false` during
maintenance.

On macOS, `macos/install-public-fds-relay-owner.sh` installs the origin and
discovery-updating tunnel as login services. The bundled tunnel runner removes
inherited desktop proxy variables and forces HTTP/2 over TCP. This avoids the
common combination where a proxy returns a `198.18.0.0/15` Fake-IP while
QUIC/UDP never reaches a Cloudflare edge. Discovery is marked offline at
startup and exit, and is only enabled after the new public URL passes an
external `/health` probe. The probe uses DoH so a brief NXDOMAIN during Quick
Tunnel creation is not retained by the host's negative DNS cache.

If discovery says online but a `trycloudflare.com` hostname returns NXDOMAIN,
that disposable Quick Tunnel has expired. Restart the updated tunnel runner;
do not leave clients pointed at the stale URL. Repeated
`Failed to dial a quic connection` messages with `198.18.*` identify the
Fake-IP/QUIC failure handled by the HTTP/2 runner.

The relay only builds and uploads the verified image. The owner's local Mi
Home session still sends the final OTA command to their own AP01, after the
app's explicit confirmation.
